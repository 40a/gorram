# gorram

## Work In Progress!

A command line helper for interfacing with go packages

Automagically understands how to produce an interface from the command line into a Go function.

For example:

```
cat ugly.json | gorram json.Indent "" "\t"
```

The above will run encoding/json.Indent, with src = stdin and dst being a bytes.Buffer that gets written to stdout 
if json.Indent returns without an error.
